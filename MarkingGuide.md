#Marking guide for "DIY Django Mini Blog"

The following guide outlines a marking guide for the MDN Learning Area Django Topic â€” [DIY Django Mini Blog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/django_assessment_blog). Each subtask detailed in the assessment is listed below, along with an explanation of how many marks the task is worth, and the mark breakdown.

**Note:** There are numerous ways of implementing this application in Django. Any "sensible" mechanism that meets the requirements outlined in the assessment task would be deemed acceptable (that is why most of this testing is for compliance with the requirements rather than use of particular classes etc.)

The overall mark awarded is out of XX. Work out their final mark, and then divide by XX and multiply by 100 to give a percentage mark. For reference, this project (###) contains a worked example that might receive full marks. 

## Models

They need to:

* Create separate models for Blogs, Comments and Blog Authors (6 marks total)
  * 2 marks for having a model for blogs
  * 2 marks for having a model for blog authors
  * 2 marks for having a model for blog comments

* Define a ``__str__()`` method for all models (3 marks)
* Define a ``get_absolute_url()`` method for Blogs and Blog Authors  (2 marks)
* Use a ForeignKey field for the relationship between Users and Blog Authors, Blogs and Blog Authors and between blogs and Comments (3 points (one for each relationship).

Hint: The relationships should look something like this:
